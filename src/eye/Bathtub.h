// Bathtub curve — the canonical SerDes timing-margin plot.
//
// For each UI offset, compute the empirical probability that a sample
// clock aligned at that offset would land in a "wrong" zero-crossing
// region of the eye. The result has the characteristic bathtub shape:
// flat and low near the eye centre, rising steeply toward the UI
// edges where ISI / jitter pushes the trace across the threshold.
//
// We derive it from the populated EyeGrid by:
//   1. Locating the mid-voltage row (v ≈ ½·(v_min + v_max)).
//   2. Treating each populated bin in that row as a crossing event.
//   3. Building cumulative-density curves from both UI edges inward.
//   4. The probability at offset t is the minimum of the left and
//      right cumulatives — the chance a sample landed beyond t in
//      whichever direction is closer.
//
// This is a single-tap statistical eye, not a full PAM-N / equalizer-
// aware bathtub. Good enough to answer "what's my 10⁻³ timing margin?"
// for the synthesized eyes sikit produces.
