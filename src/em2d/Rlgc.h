// Per-unit-length RLGC matrix extraction for N-conductor 2D cross-sections.
//
// For an N-signal-conductor system over a ground reference, the Maxwell
// capacitance matrix C is N×N with:
//   C[i][i] > 0    (self-capacitance to ground)
//   C[i][j] < 0    (negative of mutual coupling, i ≠ j)
// Extracted by N FDM solves, one per excited conductor.
//
// The inductance matrix L is recovered from the all-air capacitance
// matrix via L = (1/c²) · C_air⁻¹ — the standard TEM identity, exact
// for non-magnetic dielectrics (μ_r = 1).
//
// From {C, L} we derive near-end / far-end crosstalk coefficients for
// any aggressor/victim pair via the textbook modal-mismatch formula.
