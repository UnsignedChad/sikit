// 2D finite-difference Laplace solver for PCB cross-sections.
//
// Solves ∇·(ε ∇V) = 0 with Dirichlet boundary conditions:
//   conductors → fixed V (their `voltage` field)
//   outer box  → V = 0
//
// Uses successive over-relaxation (SOR). The discrete stencil weights cell
// faces by face-averaged ε (geometric mean of the two adjacent cells'
// ε_r), which keeps the operator self-adjoint and conserves flux through
// dielectric interfaces.
